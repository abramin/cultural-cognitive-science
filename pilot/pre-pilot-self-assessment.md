# Pre-pilot Self Assessment

## 1. What is my current understanding of the mind-body problem?

A problem arising from a particular framing of mind and body as two completely different substances - mind-body dualism. The issue is that if mind and body are so different, with completely different origins or natures, how can they possibly interact?

Consciousness is the subjective experience of living organisms, the sense of being me (consciousness is better named awareness, so as not to confuse it with self-consciousness, used to mean reflection on the mind's contents). 

Investigating consciousness naturally leads to questions of its origin - how do this consciousness arise - how is it that I am conscious? Descartes' dualism introduced the concept of mind body separation but did not land on either a materialist (physicalist) or idealist solution. Up until the 20th century, idealists had the upper hand, no doubt buoyed by Christian doctrines of the soul and free will. As physicalist theories came to predominate and the mind became associated entirely with the brain, the question then became, how does the brain give rise to consciousness?

## 2. What positions do I currently hold?

I lean towards idealism, but which of flavour I am uncertain. Solutions such as Kastrup's analytic idealism, pantheism, and panentheism all have their strengths and weaknesses. On the one hand, I see the debate between physicalists and idealists as one of focus - i.e depending on the questions we want to answer we can look through one lens or the other. The issue with physicalism is that it ignores or denies so much of human experience (despite being incredibly productive of material well being). The hard problem of consciousness is only a problem for materialists, if we assume consciousness as foundational there is no problem (I think the hard problem of matter is more easily addressed). 

## 3. How confident am I in these beliefs?

A strange question, like asking how confident am I that evolution is the best theory of speciation we currently have. I am confident that physicalism fails to address certain aspects of the human experience (mystical states, religious experience) and that philosophically it is problematic. Let's say 8, that the theories of idealism are better suited to explain reality than materialist ones.

## 4. What do I hope to learn from this pilot?

### About the topic (consciousness, mind-body problem)
    
* What are some good arguments for the origin of consciousness, and or solutions to the mind-body problem.

### About learning methods (autodidactic vs. AI-mediated)

* Will adopting an AI free learning method make me a better thinker or will using AI enhance my thinking? (instead of making me a lazier thinker).
* Will AI prove a sufficient surrogate for a human teacher?

### About my own learning capabilities
* Will learning on my own, without a human or AI teacher, allow me to master the material?
* Will the fact that I am not dealing with a human, make me less diligent, more likely to take shortcuts or insufficiently interrogate the extent of my learning?

## 5. What would constitute "success" in each condition?

### What would make Pilot A successful?

* All readings, assignments, logs done and rules followed

### What would make Pilot B successful?

* All readings, assignments, logs done and rules followed

### What would make the overall pilot successful?

* A clear way forward to the full length project, with enough detail to write the proposal.
* Some initial differences noted between the two conditions.
