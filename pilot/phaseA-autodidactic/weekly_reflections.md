# Weekly Reflection: Pilot A, Week [1]
## Date: [23/11/2025]
### What I Understood Well This Week:

Could make sense of Chalmers and Nagels points for the most part.  I followed the arguments on objectivity, subjectivity, Chalmers 3 principles for his proposed theory of consciousness, Nagels similar point about an objective language of subjectivity..

### What Remains Confusing:
Chalmers’ point about a posteriori necessity and its relation to the hard problem of consciousness.
Initially I didn't quite follow Chalmers’ thought experiment about replacing neurons with silicon isomorphs and the inverting qualia. I understand the thought experiment, but I´m not entirely convinced by his conclusion about the “extra” thought. 

### How I Handled Difficulties:
Tried reading SEP and Wikipedia on a posteriori necessity but found the Wikipedia article unclear and the SEP too much and not focussed on my question. 
I drew a diagram of the thought experiment on neurons and silicon isomorphs.

### Strategies I Developed:
Next reading I will read through once without taking notes, then a second reading with notes, then a day or 2 later another re-reading following with my notes and amending as needed. 
Diagram as needed.

### What I Wish I Had Access To:

Being able to consult secondary sources on the readings and topic would have helped clarify some concepts. Being able to read responses to them would have helped as hearing others' reactions help me see if my understanding is correct or I wildly misinterpreted a text.
Being able to speak to someone about the readings would help. A peer could act as a sounding board to see if I understand and can explain the ideas clearly. Less likely, but an expert or authority in the field would be even more helpful in answering questions and guiding me. 
I think Chalmers (and many of his arguments) are materialist biased so I think he begs the question on the metaphysics of some of his proposals (“We know physical processes cause mental ones…”)

### Confidence Assessment (1-10): 7
### Why This Rating: 

I could follow the readings, I reread each of them and my notes at least twice so more deeply than I normally read. I think I find drawing out the central arguments of an essay challenging (at least these two pieces).
I think I failed to grasp until the end that the real point of both pieces was really about 3rd person perspectives on first person experience. Even though both pieces dealt with the hard problem of consciousness, and the failure of reductive theories to explain subjective experience, they weren't primarily about the metaphysical question, but more epistemologically focussed. I had mostly approached this topic metaphysically so couldn't see the epistemological purpose of each essay until today.
