### What I Read/Studied:

Pages 11-16 Chalmers(1995) - Facing up to the problem of consciousness, 
up to second principle of theory of consciousness

### What Was Difficult:
* Wasn´t quite sure about metaphysical gap point and a posteriori necessity, but it was incidental to his main point

### Questions That Arose:

 "We know that experience depends on physical processes..." - this seemed question begging, do we know this or do we assume this as physicalists?

### How I Addressed Confusion (or didn't):

* Looked up wikipedia seciton on a posteriori necessity, understand basic idea (having read about analytic/sythetic distinciton in Kant earlier this year)

### What I Wish I Had Access To:

* A tutor who i can discuss the reading with to help clarify my understanding

### Confidence Level in Today's Learning (1-10):

7

### Additional Notes:

* will finish remaining 3 pages tomorrow morning and review notes to check I answered Day 2 questions

### What I Read/Studied:

First half of Chalmers(1995) - Facing up to the problem of consciousness

### What Was Difficult:

Deciding what was central to his argument and what was illustrative detail.
He repeated his central thesis that the very nature of experience makes it 
opaque to standard cognitive scientific techniques - I think understand the argument.

### Questions That Arose:

What are possible responses to his argument that the hard problem is conceptually different to the easy problems?
So far he doesn´t mention idealism/pantheism as an "explanation" - i.e. consciousness is the brute fact.

### How I Addressed Confusion (or didn't):
 
The text was clear enough

### What I Wish I Had Access To:

When reading an article like this, I often look up counter-arguments to check that I am understanding the author correctly.

### Confidence Level in Today's Learning (1-10):

8 

### Additional Notes:

I´ve not read this before but i´ve encountered the basic argument second hand several times over the last 20 years.
