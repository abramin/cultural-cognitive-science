## Overview and Rationale

### The Central Question

**Does AI guidance produce better learning outcomes than pure autodidacticism?**

Before committing to a full four-year programme of AI-mediated study in cognitive-cultural science, this pilot tests whether the elaborate AI framework adds sufficient value to justify its complexity.

### The Experimental Design

The pilot compares two parallel learning experiences:

- **Pilot A (Weeks 1-3):** Study philosophy of mind (consciousness and intentionality) entirely through self-directed reading, with **no AI assistance**
- **Pilot B (Weeks 4-6):** Study philosophy of mind (mind-body problem and embodiment) with **continuous AI guidance and feedback**
- **Week 7:** Systematic comparison and evidence-based decision about proceeding

### What Makes This Rigorous

This is not casual self-improvement but a methodologically structured investigation:

- **Controlled comparison:** Similar topics, similar difficulty, similar time investment
- **Multiple data sources:** Essays, daily logs, self-assessments, ethnographic reflections
- **Genuine openness to negative results:** If AI adds little value, that's a legitimate and important finding
- **Clear decision criteria:** Week 7 requires justified decision based on evidence, not assumptions
- **Failure is productive:** The pilot succeeds if it reveals what works and what doesn't

### Success Criteria

**The pilot succeeds if:**

- [ ] You complete all reading and writing requirements for both conditions
- [ ] You maintain consistent documentation (daily logs, weekly reflections)
- [ ] Your Week 7 analysis demonstrates genuine reflection, not going through motions
- [ ] You make an evidence-based decision about proceeding
- [ ] You learn something valuable regardless of which condition "wins"

**The pilot fails if:**

- [ ] You skip readings or rush through without real engagement
- [ ] Documentation becomes perfunctory ("I read today. It was fine.")
- [ ] Week 7 analysis is superficial or predetermined
- [ ] Decision is based on sunk costs rather than actual experience
- [ ] You treat the pilot as a formality rather than genuine experiment

### Time Commitment

- **Weeks 1-3 (Pilot A):** 12-15 hours per week
- **Transition Week:** 2-3 days off
- **Weeks 4-6 (Pilot B):** 12-15 hours per week  
- **Week 7:** 10-12 hours for analysis

**Total:** Approximately 90-100 hours over 7 weeks

- **Transition:** 2-3 days completely off
- **Pilot B:** 2-2.5 hours per day, 6 days per week, for 3 weeks
- **Week 7:** 10-12 hours across the week

**Choose your start date:** Pick a Monday to begin Week 1 (Pilot A)

**Mark it in your calendar and commit.**

---

## Pilot A: Autodidactic Condition

**Duration:** Weeks 1-3  
**Topic:** Consciousness and Intentionality  
**Central Question:** Can third-person science capture first-person experience?

### The Learning Constraint

**YOU MAY:**
- Read the assigned texts at your own pace
- Take notes in your own words
- Consult dictionaries and encyclopedias
- Use Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy for definitions
- Reread difficult passages
- Look up unfamiliar philosophical terms
- Use your existing knowledge and reasoning

**YOU MAY NOT:**
- Ask Claude (or any AI) questions about the readings
- Use AI to help understand, interpret, or discuss the material
- Seek secondary sources that interpret these texts (no summaries, lectures, explainer videos)
- Discuss readings with other humans (to maintain comparison with Pilot B's isolation)

**The principle:** You are entirely dependent on primary texts and your own intellectual resources.

### Week 5: Deepening with AI as Interlocutor

**Goal:** Understand reductive neurophilosophy and its critique through embodiment

**Reading Assignment:**
1. Mumford, "Authoritarian and Democratic Technics" (~15 pages)
2. Churchland, *Neurophilosophy* Part II: "Recent Developments in the Philosophy of Science" (~100-150 pages)
3. Ingold, *The Perception of the Environment* - Selections (~20 pages)

**Note on Week 5 workload:** This is the most reading-intensive week of Pilot B due to Churchland's philosophical density. Plan accordingly—you may need 3-3.5 hours on Days 2-4.

#### Day 1: Monday (2 hours)

**Reading:**
- Mumford, "Authoritarian and Democratic Technics"

**Before Reading:**
- **Ask Claude:** "Give me context on Mumford's essay. What is his distinction between authoritarian and democratic technics? How might this relate to debates about consciousness and expertise?"

**Tasks:**
- Read with Claude's framing
- Focus on: What makes knowledge systems "authoritarian"?

**After Reading:**
- **Ask Claude:** "This week I read Churchland's neurophilosophy, which argues for reductive explanation. Help me think: Does Churchland's approach represent 'authoritarian' expertise—claiming to understand consciousness better than conscious subjects—or is it legitimate science? How should I think about this as I read her?"

**Documentation:**
- `/ai_interactions/week5_day1.md`
- Daily log

---

#### Day 2: Tuesday (3-3.5 hours)

**Reading:**
- Churchland, Part II: "Recent Developments in the Philosophy of Science" - First third (approximately pages 1-50 of Part II)

**Before Reading:**
- **Ask Claude:** "I'm beginning Churchland's Part II on philosophy of science and intertheoretic reduction. This is dense material. What's the overall structure of her argument? What should I prioritize? What will be most difficult?"

**Tasks:**
- Read carefully—this is dense philosophy of science
- Take detailed notes
- Focus on: What is her alternative to logical empiricist reduction?
- **Ask questions as needed:**
  - Example: "Churchland discusses 'intertheoretic reduction.' How does her account differ from Nagel-Schaffner reduction? Why does she need a post-empiricist theory?"

**Evening Check-in:**
- **Ask Claude:** "Here's what I understood from the first third of Part II [summary]. Is this accurate? What connections or distinctions am I missing? What should I watch for as I continue?"

**Documentation:**
- `/ai_interactions/week5_day2.md`
- Daily log: Note difficulty level and time spent

---

#### Day 3: Wednesday (3-3.5 hours)

**Reading:**
- Churchland, Part II - Second third (approximately pages 51-100)

**Tasks:**
- Continue through middle section of Part II
- Focus on: Her responses to dualist arguments and the multiple realizability objection
- **Ask Claude questions:**
  - Example: "Churchland responds to property dualism and qualia arguments. What's her strategy? How does this connect to her reduction account?"
  - Example: "She discusses the 'co-evolution' of neuroscience and psychology. What exactly does this methodology entail? How is it different from simply reducing psychology to neuroscience?"

**Evening Check-in:**
- **Ask Claude:** "I'm partway through Churchland's philosophical arguments. How do her responses to dualism and anti-reductionism set up her broader neurophilosophical project? What's the relationship between her theory of reduction and her eliminativist tendencies?"

**Documentation:**
- `/ai_interactions/week5_day3.md`
- Daily log

---

#### Day 4: Thursday (3-3.5 hours)

**Reading:**
- Churchland, Part II - Final third (approximately pages 101-150)
- Begin Ingold, Chapter 1: The Organism and its Environment (pp. 13-25)

**Tasks:**
- Complete Churchland Part II
- **Extended dialogue with Claude:**
  - "I've finished Churchland's Part II. Help me synthesize: What is the core of her reductive neurophilosophy? How does the 'co-evolution' methodology work? What does she think happens to folk psychology—revision or elimination? How does her position differ from eliminative materialism?"
  - Clarify and consolidate understanding before moving to Ingold

- Begin Ingold Chapter 1
- **Ask Claude:** "I'm moving from Churchland to Ingold. How does Ingold's ecological anthropology relate to philosophical debates about mind? What should I look for?"

**Evening Check-in:**
- **Ask Claude:** "Now that I've completed Churchland's philosophical framework and started Ingold's ecological anthropology, help me see: How do their approaches to mind/consciousness differ fundamentally? Both claim to be materialist and anti-Cartesian, but they seem to point in different directions. What would Ingold say about Churchland's reductionism?"

**Documentation:**
- `/ai_interactions/week5_day4.md`
- Daily log: Reflect on Churchland's difficulty and comprehension

---

#### Day 5: Friday (2.5 hours)

**Reading:**
- Ingold, Chapter 16: On Weaving a Basket (pp. 339-348)

**Tasks:**
- Complete Ingold readings
- Focus on: skilled practice, embodied knowledge, "enskillment"
- **Extended dialogue:**
  - "Let's discuss the relationship between Ingold and Churchland. Both claim to be materialist and anti-Cartesian, but approach consciousness differently. Help me think through:
    1. How would Ingold critique Churchland's reductionism?
    2. How would Churchland respond to Ingold's skilled practice and 'dwelling'?
    3. Are they addressing the same phenomenon or different aspects?
    4. Does Ingold's 'enskillment' escape reduction, or is it just complex neural processes Churchland would explain differently?"

**Documentation:**
- `/ai_interactions/week5_day5.md`
- Daily log: How is my AI use evolving? Better questions?

---

#### Day 6: Saturday (2 hours)

**Essay Planning with AI:**

**Essay Question:**  
**"Is Consciousness Reducible to Brain Processes? Evaluate with reference to Churchland and at least one critic."**

**Task:**
- **Ask Claude:** "I need to write this essay. Given my readings—Kim (or Stanford Encyclopedia entries), Merleau-Ponty, Churchland's Part II, Ingold, Mumford—help me think through:
  1. What should my thesis address? What are the key dimensions of the reduction question?
  2. How should I structure the essay?
  3. Which thinkers should I focus on? I could use Merleau-Ponty or Ingold as primary critic of Churchland—which offers stronger critical purchase?
  4. What connections or tensions should I highlight?
  5. How do I avoid simply summarizing positions—what level of critical analysis is needed?"

**Important:** Don't have Claude write outline—develop it yourself with guidance. Claude should help you think through structure, not provide the structure.

**Documentation:**
- Save your outline (your work, not Claude's)
- `/ai_interactions/week5_day6.md`
- Daily log

## Final Notes

### On Honesty

The pilot only works if you're brutally honest. If Pilot A produced equal or better understanding than Pilot B, that's a valid and important finding. Don't proceed with an elaborate AI framework just because you've invested effort in designing it.

### On Flexibility

If during either pilot you realize the comparison isn't working as designed (readings too hard/easy, time estimates off, structure problematic), pause and adjust. Document why. This is more honest than forcing through flawed design.

### On "Negative" Results

If pilot reveals AI adds little value, that's not failure—it's success. You've discovered this before committing to 16 weeks of Module 1. The pilot has done its job.

### On Beginning

Set your start date.  
Acquire your readings.  
Create your folders.  
Write your baseline self-assessment.

Then begin.
