# “Conditions Under Which I Will Abandon This Project, and What That Abandonment Will Mean”

## Circumstances constituting productive abandonment 

* Practical considerations - AI models no longer available or costs become prohibitive
* Conflicting priorities - e.g. new job requires full time learning outside work
* Early experience shows that self learning (without AI) is superior so AI component abandoned.
* It becomes apparent that human oversight required even in the form of peers and that pure self-refelction insufficient (echo chamber)
* Any other discovery of serious flaws with project design means it must be abandoned, resdesigned, and begun anew.


## Circumstances constituting mere attrition 

* Loss of motivation
* Repeated delays in completing work means momentum can't be maintained (lack of time, too many interuptions)

## If project abandoned

* Write 1000 word summary of findings so far, reflections of what went well, what could have been improved. Possible changes to project if taken up again.
