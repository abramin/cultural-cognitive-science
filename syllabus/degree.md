# Cognitive cultural science

# **BSc (Hons) Cognitive–Cultural Science**

Integrating Psychology, Philosophy, and Anthropology

# **Programme Overview**

The BSc (Hons) Cognitive–Cultural Science is an interdisciplinary degree uniting psychology, philosophy, and anthropology into a single study of the human mind as both a biological and cultural phenomenon.

It combines empirical research methods with reflective and comparative analysis, exploring cognition, consciousness, and culture through the lenses of neuroscience, phenomenology, and symbolic anthropology.

The programme ensures graduates possess both scientific competence and philosophical depth. It trains students to analyse human behaviour quantitatively while situating psychological processes within historical, social, and symbolic contexts.

Aims:

- To develop a scientifically grounded yet humanistic understanding of mind and behaviour.
- To cultivate the ability to interpret psychological processes as culturally and linguistically mediated.
- To integrate empirical experimentation with philosophical reflection and ethnographic insight.
- To prepare graduates for professional psychology, cognitive science, or interdisciplinary research careers.

# **Self-Directed Science Component**

All empirical modules include at-home, computer-based labs using open-source tools and public datasets.

Students will:

- Reproduce classic experiments (Stroop, visual memory, social conformity) using PsychoPy or PsyToolkit.
- Conduct small-scale behavioural studies via online platforms (Pavlovia, Gorilla, or OpenSesame).
- Analyse open neuroimaging datasets (OpenNeuro, NeuroVault) with Python/R.
- Simulate cognitive processes (Bayesian reasoning, reinforcement learning, connectionist models).
- Use ethnographic data archives to compare cultural psychological findings.

# **Programme Ethos**

The BSc (Hons) Cognitive–Cultural Science develops scholars capable of bridging the gap between data and meaning. Graduates emerge fluent in scientific reasoning, philosophically literate, and anthropologically informed—able to interpret the human mind not only as a biological system but as a cultural and moral phenomenon.
