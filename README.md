# **Experimental Framework: AI-Accredited BSc in Cognitive–Cultural Science**

## **1. Purpose and Research Question**

This programme is conceived as a long-form educational and anthropological experiment exploring how an advanced AI system can act as tutor, assessor, and co-researcher within a rigorous, self-directed university curriculum.

**Primary Aim:**

To examine the feasibility and epistemic implications of completing a full undergraduate-level degree under AI supervision, with authentic academic structure, assessment, and reflection—whilst systematically documenting where this arrangement succeeds and where it necessarily fails.

**Core Research Questions:**

1. Can AI reliably facilitate deep, self-directed learning in a complex interdisciplinary field?
2. How does the dialogical relationship between learner and AI reshape pedagogical authority, assessment, and intellectual formation?
3. What are the ethical and epistemological consequences of treating an AI as an academic assessor?
4. What does AI-mediated learning make possible that autodidacticism alone does not, and what does it render impossible that traditional education provides?

## **2. Design Overview**

The project replicates the structure of a BPS-aligned, Cambridge-style BSc (Hons) in Cognitive–Cultural Science, combining psychology, philosophy, and anthropology.

The student (Alex) will complete all academic work, while the AI functions as:

| **Role** | **Function** | **Limitation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tutor | Provides readings, weekly outcomes, exercises, and clarification | Cannot provide embodied expertise or professional intuition |
| Feedback Provider | Offers detailed, criterion-referenced commentary on submitted work | Pattern-matching, not judgment born of experience |
| Indicative Assessor | Estimates grade bands with detailed justification | Statistical inference, not authoritative evaluation |
| Supervisor | Guides reflective and research development | Cannot be genuinely surprised or provide truly alien perspectives |
| Ethnographic Participant | Becomes an object of analysis within the student’s own anthropological reflections | Self-reports are unreliable; AI has no privileged access to its own processes |

## **3. Methodology**

### **Data Collection**

- All interactions, assignments, and feedback will be archived (Markdown + PDF files)
- Reflective journals will document subjective experience, trust, disagreement, and perception of AI agency
- Periodic “meta-reviews” will assess pedagogical progress and the evolving human-AI relationship
- **Failure Appendix** will collect documented instances of system breakdown, inadequate AI responses, and rejected feedback
- External touchstone responses (when received) will be archived as reality-checks

### **Ethical Considerations**

- No external human subjects are involved beyond optional, bounded requests for feedback
- All outputs remain self-authored; AI provides formative guidance only
- The AI cannot issue an accredited degree; outcomes are symbolic and research-oriented
- The experiment may be abandoned at any time if it proves epistemically unsound or personally unproductive

### **Comparative Element**

Before committing to the full programme, complete **two pilot modules**:

1. **Module A (Pure Autodidacticism)**: Design, read, and write about one topic entirely without AI involvement
2. **Module B (Full Framework)**: Complete a parallel module using the complete AI-mediated structure

Compare the outcomes, learning experience, and quality of work to determine whether the AI apparatus adds sufficient value to justify its complexity.

## **4. Assessment and Feedback Workflow**

### **For Each Assignment:**

1. **Submission**
- Submit completed work with a brief cover note explaining your aims and any specific concerns
1. **AI Feedback**
- Detailed, criterion-referenced commentary across five dimensions (Argument, Knowledge, Integration, Critical Engagement, Style)
- **Indicative grade band** (First/2:1/2:2/Third/Fail) with specific mark and detailed justification
- Identification of strengths and clear guidance for improvement
1. **Self-Assessment**
- Write 300-word evaluation of your own work
- Assign yourself a grade with reasoning
- Note where you agree/disagree with AI assessment and why
1. **Progress Record**
- Maintain cumulative transcript noting:
    - Module completion dates
    - AI indicative grades with justification
    - Your self-assessed grades with reasoning
    - Pattern analysis: convergence/divergence over time

### **Additional Assessment Structures:**

**Adversarial Reading (Every Third Essay):**

- Submit two versions: your actual position and an equally rigorous contrary argument
- Receive feedback on both
- Write short analysis of which argument was stronger and why

**Integration Essays (At Disciplinary Boundaries):**

- Address incompatible epistemological claims between disciplines
- AI responds from different disciplinary personae to make incommensurabilities visible

## **5. Structural Fragility: Mandatory Breaking Points**

Every **six weeks**, submit a 1,000-word paper: **“Where This Framework Is Failing”**

Address:

- What questions has the AI been unable to address adequately?
- Where have you felt the absence of human interlocution most acutely?
- What aspects of the discipline require precisely what this arrangement cannot provide?
- What modifications to the framework might address these inadequacies?

At each breaking point, you may:

- Redesign elements of the framework
- Continue with documented awareness of limitations
- Abandon the project with a final reflective essay

## **6. Practical Components**

Each module must include at least one **practical element** where you generate or analyze actual data:

- Structured interviews with analysis
- Observational ethnographic data collection
- Self-administered cognitive experiments
- Statistical analysis of datasets

Submit both the analysis and a reflection on what practical engagement revealed that reading alone could not.

## **7. External Touchstones**

After completing each module, identify one working academic in the relevant field and send them:

- One-page summary of module content
- Your best essay from the module
- Brief, respectful request for any comments they care to offer

Archive all responses (or non-responses) as data about how your work appears to embodied disciplinary expertise.

## **8. Reflective Ethnography Component**

Maintain parallel documentation across three registers:

### **A. Weekly Ethnographic Journal**

Prompts (structured, but allow space for unexpected observations):

- How did the AI frame authority and expertise this week?
- When did I resist or reinterpret its feedback?
- What felt genuinely dialogical versus scripted?
- How does this change my sense of “teacher,” “student,” and “knowledge”?
- **Open reflection**: What was most surprising or troubling this week?

### **B. Meta-Learning Journal**

Parallel shadow curriculum tracking what you learn about:

- AI capabilities and limitations in handling ambiguity, disagreement, expertise
- Your own learning patterns—weaknesses, strengths, biases
- What “education” means when divorced from credentialing and institutional context

### **C. Failure Appendix**

Collecting:

- Essays or sections identified as significantly flawed
- Questions the AI could not adequately answer
- Instances when AI feedback was demonstrably wrong
- Times you ignored AI feedback and were right to do so

## **9. Scheduled Randomness**

Once per month, use a randomizing mechanism to select:

- An article from a journal outside your planned reading
- A topic for a 1,000-word exploratory essay (generated by combining random elements)
- An unprepared question to pose to the AI

Work seriously with whatever arrives, even if tangential to main concerns.

## **10. Mid-Point Viva**

Halfway through the programme, prepare a 3,000-word paper: **“What I Have Learned and How I Know I Have Learned It”**

Address:

- What you now understand that you did not understand before
- Evidence that this understanding is genuine rather than illusory
- How your thinking has changed, with specific examples
- What the AI contributed and what it could not contribute
- Whether continuation is justified

AI provides detailed evaluation. You make the final decision about continuation or dignified exit.

## **11. Outputs**

### **Primary Academic Work:**

- Module essays, projects, data analyses with assessments
- Practical component reports

### **Ethnographic Documentation:**

- Weekly journals
- Breaking-point papers
- Meta-learning journal
- Failure appendix
- External touchstone archive

### **Final Theses (Three Interwoven Essays):**

1. **The Academic Essay** (4,000 words)
Conventional scholarship demonstrating mastery of chosen topic within cognitive-cultural science
2. **The Ethnographic Essay** (4,000 words)
Analysis of the learning process, AI-human relationship, what this arrangement made possible and impossible
3. **The Methodological Essay** (3,000 words)
Rigorous assessment of the experiment itself—what it can and cannot tell us about AI pedagogy, limitations, implications for future research

### **Shadow Curriculum Thesis:**

**“The Pedagogy of AI-Mediated Learning: A Case Study”** (5,000 words)

Separate output potentially of interest to educational researchers or AI ethicists

## **12. Conditions for Abandonment**

**Before beginning**, write a sealed document: **“Conditions Under Which I Will Abandon This Project, and What That Abandonment Will Mean”**

Specify:

- Circumstances constituting productive abandonment (e.g., framework is epistemically unsound)
- Circumstances constituting mere attrition (e.g., loss of motivation)
- What you will write if you abandon the project

Deposit with timestamp. If abandonment occurs, compare actual reasons with predicted ones. Divergence becomes data.

## **13. Evaluation Criteria for the Experiment**

**Success indicators:**

- Completion of pilot comparison with clear evidence that AI framework adds value
- Production of work meeting upper-second or first-class standards (as assessed through dual AI-indicative and self-assessment)
- Evidence of self-directed research competence
- Rich ethnographic insights documented in breaking-point papers and failure appendix
- External touchstone responses indicating work meets professional standards

**Acceptable failure:**

- Productive abandonment with clear articulation of why
- Systematic documentation of where AI pedagogy proves inadequate
- Evidence of genuine learning even if structure proves unsustainable

**Unacceptable failure:**

- Continuation despite loss of reflective engagement
- Self-deception about learning in absence of evidence
- Abandonment through attrition without analysis

## **14. Module Structure Template**

Each module includes:

- **Core Reading** (8-12 texts)
- **Supplementary Reading** (selected based on interests revealed during module)
- **3-4 Short Essays** (1,500-2,000 words each)
- **1 Practical Component** with analysis
- **1 Integration Essay** (if crossing disciplinary boundaries)
- **Every third essay**: Adversarial double-submission
- **Module Completion**: External touchstone submission

## **15. Next Steps**

### **Immediate Actions:**

1. **Write Abandonment Document** specifying conditions and deposit with timestamp
