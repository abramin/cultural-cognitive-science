## Overview and Rationale

### The Central Question

**Does AI guidance produce better learning outcomes than pure autodidacticism?**

Before committing to a full four-year programme of AI-mediated study in cognitive-cultural science, this pilot tests whether the elaborate AI framework adds sufficient value to justify its complexity.

### The Experimental Design

The pilot compares two parallel learning experiences:

- **Pilot A (Weeks 1-3):** Study philosophy of mind (consciousness and intentionality) entirely through self-directed reading, with **no AI assistance**
- **Pilot B (Weeks 4-6):** Study philosophy of mind (mind-body problem and embodiment) with **continuous AI guidance and feedback**
- **Week 7:** Systematic comparison and evidence-based decision about proceeding

### What Makes This Rigorous

This is not casual self-improvement but a methodologically structured investigation:

- **Controlled comparison:** Similar topics, similar difficulty, similar time investment
- **Multiple data sources:** Essays, daily logs, self-assessments, ethnographic reflections
- **Genuine openness to negative results:** If AI adds little value, that's a legitimate and important finding
- **Clear decision criteria:** Week 7 requires justified decision based on evidence, not assumptions
- **Failure is productive:** The pilot succeeds if it reveals what works and what doesn't

### Success Criteria

**The pilot succeeds if:**

- [ ] You complete all reading and writing requirements for both conditions
- [ ] You maintain consistent documentation (daily logs, weekly reflections)
- [ ] Your Week 7 analysis demonstrates genuine reflection, not going through motions
- [ ] You make an evidence-based decision about proceeding
- [ ] You learn something valuable regardless of which condition "wins"

**The pilot fails if:**

- [ ] You skip readings or rush through without real engagement
- [ ] Documentation becomes perfunctory ("I read today. It was fine.")
- [ ] Week 7 analysis is superficial or predetermined
- [ ] Decision is based on sunk costs rather than actual experience
- [ ] You treat the pilot as a formality rather than genuine experiment

### Time Commitment

- **Weeks 1-3 (Pilot A):** 12-15 hours per week
- **Transition Week:** 2-3 days off
- **Weeks 4-6 (Pilot B):** 12-15 hours per week  
- **Week 7:** 10-12 hours for analysis

**Total:** Approximately 90-100 hours over 7 weeks

**Length:** 500 words

Write a document titled **"Pre-Pilot Baseline"** answering these questions:

**1. What is my current understanding of the mind-body problem?**
- Don't research—write what you currently think
- What is consciousness?
- How does mind relate to brain?

**2. What positions do I currently hold?**
- Am I a dualist (mind and body are separate)?
- Am I a physicalist (mind is just brain)?
- Am I unsure?
- Why do I hold this position?

**3. How confident am I in these beliefs?**
- Rate yourself 1-10
- Explain the rating

**4. What do I hope to learn from this pilot?**

**Mark it in your calendar and commit.**

---

## Pilot A: Autodidactic Condition

**Duration:** Weeks 1-3  
**Topic:** Consciousness and Intentionality  
**Central Question:** Can third-person science capture first-person experience?

### The Learning Constraint

**YOU MAY:**
- Read the assigned texts at your own pace
- Take notes in your own words
- Consult dictionaries and encyclopedias
- Use Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy for definitions
- Reread difficult passages
- Look up unfamiliar philosophical terms
- Use your existing knowledge and reasoning

**YOU MAY NOT:**
- Ask Claude (or any AI) questions about the readings
- Use AI to help understand, interpret, or discuss the material
- Seek secondary sources that interpret these texts (no summaries, lectures, explainer videos)
- Discuss readings with other humans (to maintain comparison with Pilot B's isolation)

**The principle:** You are entirely dependent on primary texts and your own intellectual resources.

### Purpose

Rest and approach Pilot B fresh, without fatigue.

### Rules

**DO:**
- Take genuine time off from academic work
- Engage in different activities
- Rest mentally and physically
- Organize Pilot B materials

**DON'T:**
- Think about consciousness or mind-body problems
- Reread Pilot A materials
- Begin Pilot B readings early
- Compare the conditions yet

### Optional: Embodied Learning Micro-Pilot

**Duration:** 2-3 hours over 2 days (optional)

**Activity:** Learn something through practice, not reading

**Options:**
- Work with a real dataset (statistical analysis)
- Conduct and transcribe an interview
- Learn a memory technique and practice it
- Try meditation and document phenomenology

**Documentation:**
- Brief essay (500 words): "What I Learned By Doing Rather Than Reading"
- Question: How does embodied engagement differ from textual learning?

**Purpose:** Introduces embodied/practical knowledge as comparison point. Connects to Ingold's theory in Pilot B.

**This is entirely optional.**

---

## Pilot B: AI-Mediated Condition

**Duration:** Weeks 4-6  
**Topic:** Mind-Body Problem and Embodiment  
**Central Questions:** What is the relationship between mind and body? Can consciousness be reduced to brain processes? What does embodiment reveal that reduction obscures?

### The Learning Enhancement

**YOU MAY:**
- Ask Claude questions at any point
- Request clarification, interpretation, guidance
- Submit reading notes for feedback
- Discuss confusions as they arise
- Ask for help structuring thinking
- Request feedback on essay drafts
- Use Claude as intellectual interlocutor

**YOU MAY NOT:**
- Use other AI systems (maintain consistency)
- Seek human guidance (maintain comparison)
- Have Claude write your essay (you must write; Claude provides feedback only)

**The principle:** You have access to AI expertise, but intellectual work remains yours.

   - Easier? More efficient? Deeper or shallower?
   - Did AI enable understanding I couldn't reach alone?
   - Or just confirm what I could figure out independently?

4. **Did AI create dependency or develop autonomy?**
   - Did I ask before trying to figure things out?
   - Or use AI strategically after attempting understanding?

5. **How did the AI relationship feel?**

**Tasks:**
- Read with Claude's framing
- Focus on: What makes knowledge systems "authoritarian"?

**After Reading:**
- **Ask Claude:** "Tomorrow I read Churchland's neurophilosophy, which argues for reductive explanation. Help me think: Does Churchland's approach represent 'authoritarian' expertise—claiming to understand consciousness better than conscious subjects—or is it legitimate science?"

#### Day 3: Wednesday (2.5 hours)

**Reading:**

**Tasks:**
- Read with framing
- Notes on: What is "dwelling"? "Enskillment"?
- **Engage Claude:**

    1. How would Ingold critique Churchland?
    2. How would Churchland respond to Ingold's skilled practice?
    3. Are they addressing the same phenomenon?"

  1. What should my thesis address? Key dimensions of reduction question?
  2. How should I structure it?
  3. Which thinkers to focus on?
  4. What connections or tensions to highlight?"

## Final Notes

### On Honesty

The pilot only works if you're brutally honest. If Pilot A produced equal or better understanding than Pilot B, that's a valid and important finding. Don't proceed with an elaborate AI framework just because you've invested effort in designing it.

### On Flexibility

If during either pilot you realize the comparison isn't working as designed (readings too hard/easy, time estimates off), pause and adjust. Document why. This is more honest than forcing through flawed design.

### On "Negative" Results

If pilot reveals AI adds little value, that's not failure—it's success. You've discovered this before committing to 16 weeks of Module 1. The pilot has done its job.

### On Beginning

Set your start date.  
Acquire your readings.  
Create your folders.  
Write your baseline self-assessment.

Then begin.
